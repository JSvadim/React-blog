# React-blog

## Quick introduction:mount_fuji::sunrise_over_mountains::
This is a client side for full-stack blog, it works in pair with express api, that is in other  repository called ***"react-blog-server"***.

I used React, Redux and Typescript.

***Currently sign in, log in, log out, add blog, get blogs, get my blogs functionality works***
### Deployed app:
 - https://tranquil-conkies-c8f7c2.netlify.app/

## Get started:

0. If you are about to setup whole app, it's better to start from express api, that is placed in other my repository ***"react-blog-server"***. If you installed it, make next steps:

1. At first clone or fork this repository;

2. Than run ***"npm i"*** command in terminal to install
all dependencies;

3. In folder ***"constans"*** in file ***"imagekit.ts*** specify your own url. Again, I suppose you've already installed Express api and know what ***"imagekit.io"*** is used for.

4. In folder ***"constans"*** in file ***"server-url.ts"*** specify url to express api.  

5. Run ***"npm start"*** and here we go!:fire::fire::fire:
